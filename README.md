# COMP2501FinalProject
Comp2501 Final Project (about chess openings) - not very comprehensive

In this project, I had to create a visual presentation on a topic of my choice - I chose to make some analysis about openings.
The data.csv file contains the processed data and the Rproj file contains some (but not all - again incomprehensive) of the code used to create visuals of the data.
Eval5 and Eval12 were produced by running a script which has stockfish analyse the position at those certain move numbers. The rest of the data was produced through the move lists themselves.
